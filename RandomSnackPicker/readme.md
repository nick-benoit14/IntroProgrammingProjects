# Random Snack Picker

you will learn:
1. Arrays
2. Variables

Peanut butter & jelly, apple, left over slice of pie, these are things that currently live in my fridge. Which one of them should I eat for a snack? I have not the slightest idea. As computer programmers we work to solve problems, let's write some code to solve the eternal after school snack question once and for good.

Note:
This page will provide an idea of how to think about the problem, some sample code written in python will also be provided. A huge part of learning to write code is learning to think in code, take some time before looking at the sample code about different ways you could solve the problem, even write out the steps you would take, you can worry about getting the actual code to run after figuring out how it is going to work.
