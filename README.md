# IntroProgrammingProjects
Repository of beginner coding project ideas. (Projects must be cooler than keeping track of student records)

Howdy All, 

Here is the idea:

Put together a cool list of beginner coding projects that are doable for new coders, engaging, and ideally appropriate for kids. 

These could be original ideas, good tutorials you have seen, something you have done in the past, or even something you have 
never done before. 

Some background information: 

  My name is Nick Benoit, I work for a STEM based youth club here in Cache Valley called, Cache Makers (more info see: http://cachemakers.weebly.com/)
  We host several different youth groups, several of which are software oriented. I am trying to put together more resource for kids 11-17
  who have neve done any coding before. It can be sometimes tricky to come up with project ideas that are rewarding, doable, and fun. 
  I am especially giving special attention to projects that can quickly result in some sort of visual feedback, as that has seemed to be 
  something that kids are particularly receptive to. 
  
  If you have any ideas, push a branch without any code with just a small description of what you might want to do and we can work from there. 
  
Thanks, 

Nick Benoit
